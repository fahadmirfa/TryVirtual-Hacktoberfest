# Virtual Trial Room App

![App Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

The Virtual Trial Room App is an innovative solution that allows users to virtually try on clothes before making a purchase. It aims to provide a seamless and interactive shopping experience, making it easier for users to visualize how different clothing items will look on them.

## Project Goals

Our main objectives for this project are:

- **Enhance the Online Shopping Experience:** We want to improve the way people shop for clothing online by providing a realistic virtual trial experience.

- **Increase Confidence in Purchases:** Users can make more informed decisions by seeing how a piece of clothing fits on their body.

- **Sustainability:** Reducing the number of returns due to ill-fitting clothes contributes to a more sustainable fashion industry.

## Features

The Virtual Trial Room App will include the following features:

1. **Image Selection:**
   - Users can select their image from the camera or gallery as a base.

2. **Clothing Catalog:**
   - A vertical list of clothes is available for users to choose from.

3. **Virtual Try-On:**
   - When users select a clothing item, it is virtually fitted to their body in the image.

4. **Realistic Fitting:**
   - The app ensures realistic resizing and fitting of clothes, considering factors like size, color, and texture.

5. **Save and Share:**
   - Users can save the edited image or share it on social media.
